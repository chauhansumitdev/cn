Modes of data transmission-
simplex
half duplex
full duplez

physical topology
way in which the network is laid out physically
ring
mesh
star
bus topology
hybrid

netork models
iso - osi model (international standard orgainzation/ open system interconnection)
 - 7 layered architecture (solving independent system to communicate with each other by solving different problems in layers)

physicl layer - (hardware)
representaion of bits - adc to dac etc
data rate
line config
physial topology
mode of transimission

data link layer
framing adding the header and trailer
mac   
access control
flow control
error control

network layer
logical addressing (ip)
routing


transport layer
service point addressing
segmentation and ressembly
connection control
err control
flow control

session layer
dialog control and syncronization

presentation layer 
translation
emcryption
compression


application layer
file transfer etc mail



switching
- circut switching
- packet switching
    - datagram approach
    - virtual approach


Data Link layer
it is divided into two sublayers -
llc - logical link control
mac - media access control

mac(lan tech)
llc - framing flow control, etc



access control
mac -
aloha
csma
csma cd etc

aloha
csma - carrier sense multiple access


flow control

sliding window protocol
stop and wait
go back and automatic repeat
selective repeat 


checksum


network layer
